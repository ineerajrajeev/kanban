# KanBan

KanBan is a simple task management application built with Flask. It allows users to create boards and add tasks to them, as well as move tasks between different stages of completion.

## Installation

To install KanBan, you will need to have Python and Flask installed on your computer.

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/username/kanban.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd kanban`
3.  Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  Run the application: `flask run`

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

Upon visiting the application, you will be prompted to create a new board. Once a board is created, you can add tasks to it and move them between different stages of completion (such as "To-Do", "In Progress", and "Done").

You can also edit and delete tasks, as well as delete entire boards.
